## Education


## About me
I am currently a software engineering bachelor at UQAM and I love it! I don't have any professional experience yet, so, in the meantime, I focus on learning cool technologies and ways to solve my everyday problems. For exemple, lately, I've touched a bit of Rust, OpenGL, Docker for deploying a discord bot, and I've also been enjoying participating in Capture The Flags events.

Enough with the professional me.
